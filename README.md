# Oil-Gas-and-Water-Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the quantities of oil, gas, and water produced from oil wells using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical production data and various machine learning algorithms to forecast the expected output of each component.

Features
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing of historical production data.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for prediction.
Evaluation: Metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
Visualization: Graphical representation of predictions vs. actual production.
